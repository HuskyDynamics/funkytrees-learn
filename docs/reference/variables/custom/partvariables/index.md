# Part Variables
#### List of craft components and their possible variable outputs.
---

Part variables are local data outputs generated by specific aircraft components. These variables allow expressions to access real-time physical data from individual parts, such as engine RPM, suspension extension, or aerodynamic forces.

## Usage
To access a part variable, you must enable its variable setter in the part variables menu and decide a variable name to write to. This will allow the part to write the data to that variable.

## Categories

### Propulsion
Telemetry from engines and rotors, providing data on rotational speeds and thrust output.

### Aerodynamics
Physical forces acting on lifting surfaces, useful for creating custom flight instruments or stability augmentation systems.

### Mechanical & Structural
Data from moving parts like rotators, hinges, and shocks, representing current positions or compression states.

### Sensors & Optics
Outputs from specialized parts like cameras, providing information on view angles and activation status.
