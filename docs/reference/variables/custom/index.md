# Custom Variables
#### Reference for user-defined data points and persistent variables within the Funky Trees language.
---

Custom variables allow for the creation of logic that exists outside of the standard built-in data set. These variables enable advanced automation, memory-persistent states, and aircraft-specific telemetry.

## Variable Setters
Global variables created and managed through the in-game Variable Setters menu.
* **Persistent Variables**: Data that can be saved or held between different states.
* **Logic Resolution**: Use of priority and activation logic to define when and how a variable's value changes.

## Part Variables
Unique data outputs generated by specific aircraft components.
* **Engine Data**: Real-time RPM, temperature, or thrust outputs.
* **Instrument Outputs**: Telemetry specifically generated for cockpit displays or mechanical gauges.

## Technical Notes
* **Namespace**: Custom variable names must not conflict with built-in variable names.
* **Global Access**: Once defined in the Variable Setters menu, a custom variable can be accessed by any expression on the aircraft.
* **Update Frequency**: Like built-in variables, custom variables are evaluated per-frame based on the game physics quality setting.
