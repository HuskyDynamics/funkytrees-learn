# State Variables
#### Technical reference for read-only telemetry and sensor data derived from the simulation.
---

State variables provide real-time information about the aircraft's physical condition and the surrounding environment. Unlike input variables, these values are read-only and are generated by the game's physics and targeting engines.

## Environmental Data
Variables related to the aircraft's position within the game world and atmospheric conditions.

## Kinematic Data
Physical measurements of the aircraft's movement, including velocity, acceleration, and G-force loads.

## Orientation Data
Angular measurements and directional data representing the aircraft's attitude relative to the horizon or world coordinates.

## Targeting Data
Information regarding currently selected targets, including distance, orientation, and weapon status.
