# Built-in Variables
#### Overview of the standard data points provided by the simulation engine.
---

Built-in variables are the default data sources provided by the game. They represent the primary link between the physical simulation and the Funky Trees language.

## Categories

* **Input Variables**: Values driven by direct user interaction with aircraft controls.
* **State Variables**: Read-only telemetry, kinematic, and sensor data derived from the simulation.

## Technical Notes
* **Read-Only**: Built-in variables cannot be redefined.
